# Security Concepts
CIA Traid are three main goals
## Confidentiality
	- Confidentiality protects information from unauthorized disclosure.
#### Confidentiality_Concerns
	1. Snooping
		- snooping gathering information that is left out in the open.
		- "Clean desk policies" protect against snooping.
	2. Dumpster Diving
		- Dumpster diving is to dump data anywere or dustbin.
		- "Shedding" protects against dumpster diving.
	3. Eavesdropping
		- listing sensitive information
		- "Rules about sensitive conversations" prevent eavesdropping
	4. Wiretapping
		- Electronic evaesdropping - listing through wire(internet)
		- "Encryption" protects against Wiretapping
	5. Social Engineering
		- The attacker uses psychological tricks to persuade an employee to give then sensitive information or access to internal systems.
		- Best defence is to "Educating users"


## Integrity
	- Integrity protects information from unauthorized changes.
#### Integrity_Concerns
	1. Unauthorized modification
		- Attacks make changes without permission.
		- "Least priviege" protects against integrity attacks
	2. Impersonation
		- Attacks pretend to be someone else
		- "User education" protects against attacks
	3. Man-in-the-middle (MITM)
		- Attacks place the attacker in the middle of a communications session.
		- "Encryption" protects against MITM attacks
	4. Replay
		- Attacks eavesdrop on logins and reuse the captured credentials.
		- "Encryption" protects against Replay attacks

## Availability
	- Availability protects authorized access to systems and data.
#### Availability
	1. Denial of service (DoS)
		- Unlimited request to a server
		- "Block unauthorized connections" to protect against denial of service attacks.
	2. Power outages
		- Naturally or Man-made
		- "Redundant power and generators" protect against power outages.
	3. Hardware failures
		- any component failures
		- "Redundant components" protect against hardware failure
	4. Destruction
		- Naturally or Man-made
		- "Backup data centers" protect against destruction.
	5. Service outages
		- Programing error and the failure of underlying equipment.
		- building systems that are resilientÂ in the face of errors and hardware failures.
