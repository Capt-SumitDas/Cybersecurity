In this chapter, I cover all Cyber security things

What is Cyber Space?

Cyberspace refers to the virtual space that provides the infrastructure, electronic medium, and related elements necessary for online global communication.

simple definition

Cyberspace is the virtual space technically created for social interactions, entertainment, business operations as well as for personal activities and interests.

The Origin of Cyberspace

Cyberspace is derived from the word Cybernetics.

Levels of Cyberspace

Core Cyberspace :

Electronic devices

Transmission or Connecting Medium

Control codes

Operation codes

Software

Data

Extended Cyberspace

Individuals

Groups

Business organizations

Government

Nation’s critical infrastructure

Components of Cyberspace

Cyberspace 6 major elements:

Physical infrastructure & Telecommunication devices

Computer systems & related software

Networks connecting computer systems and devices

Networks of networks or Internet

User & Intermediaries Access Nodes

Constituent Data

Cyber Domain Characteristics

**Connectivity:** Cyberspace interconnects a wide range of physical systems. all these elements are not physically present in one place but connected virtually in different places, but they appear as a single

**Virtuality:** Cyberspace is both unbound and virtual in nature. In other words, Cyberspace does not exist in reality.

**Expansion:** Since all communications take place within this virtual place through various means and with different types of data, Cyberspace is growing very fast.

**Ambiguity:** Due to its virtual nature, and lack of physical existence, with absolutely no centralized controlling or monitoring mechanism, Cyberspace is indistinctive and ambiguous in nature

**Interactivity:** Though it is intangible in nature, all communications and data sharing occurs seamlessly through this medium. Cyberspace is fundamentally interactive in nature.

Driving Forces of Cyberspace

Time

Space

Efficiency

Asymmetry

Anonymity

What is **Internet**?

-   Internet is a network of networks
-   The internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.

What is **Cybersecurity**?

Cyber security refers to the actions which are taken in order to prevent computer systems or the internet from unauthorized access or against attacks.

Common tools used for Cyber security

-   Passwords
-   Anti-virus/ Anti-malware software
-   Software patches
-   Firewalls
-   Two-factor Authentication
-   Encryption

Key Elements of Cyber Security

-   **Application Security**
    -   Validating the input parameters
    -   Authenticating and authorizing valid Users/Roles
    -   Managing Sessions, manipulating parameters, and managing the exceptions
    -   Security Auditing and Log Analysis
-   **Information Security**
    -   It protects information from unauthorized access
    -   Helps to avoid identity theft
    -   Promotes Information privacy
    -   Major techniques used are
        -   Identification, Authentication, and authorization of users
        -   Cryptographic techniques
-   **Network Security**
    -   It identifies threats and stops them from entering or spreading into the network
    -   Network security components include:
        -   Anti-virus and anti-spyware
        -   Firewall
        -   Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) and IDS
        -   Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)
-   **Disaster Recovery**
    -   It is a development process used to assess various types of risks
    -   Establishes different priorities thereby evolving disaster recovery strategies
    -   Every organization must develop proper disaster recovery strategies to protect itself from damage
-   **Operational Security**
    -   Operational security is a process that is used to identify critical actions in an organization
-   **End-User Education**
    -   End-user education is a must for an organization to avoid unnecessary incidents against security

Cyber Security Questions

-   **From what to protect?** – Deciding on what or from what
-   **What to protect?** – Identifying possible threats entering the system
-   **How to protect?** – The measures and implementation procedures to be used

Information system (IS)

An information system (IS) is a well-organized system for gathering, establishing, storing, and interacting with information.

Fundamental concepts in Information Systems

-   Capture both internal data and external data of the organization and its environment
-   Stores the database items over an extensive period of time
-   The transformation of data into knowledge is the main role of information systems
-   Information systems have become the backbone of the organization to support decision-making and provide value to the organization.
-   The most important challenge that organizations face in today’s digital era is **security**.

Key Challenges of Information Systems

-   Security of Information Systems
-   Contributing Factors for Insecure Information Systems
-   Protection of Information Systems and its Data
-   Issues in Information Systems
-   Security Requirements for Information Systems

Issues in Information Systems

-   Hacking
-   Jamming
-   Malware
-   Phishing
-   Identity theft
-   Cloning
-   Spamming

Principles for maintaining and securing the IS

-   Accountability
-   Management of Data
-   Trust
-   Isolation
-   Change
-   Compliance

Security Principles of Information security

-   Confidentiality
-   Integrity
-   Availability
-   Authentication
-   Non- Repudiation
-   Access Control

Security Principles have given by OSI Standards

-   The OSI Standards for Security Model defines the security principles in seven layers
    -   Authentication
    -   Access Control
    -   Non-repudiation
    -   Data Integrity
    -   Confidentiality
    -   Assurance or Availability
    -   Notarization or Signature

Security Measures

1.  Threat Identification
2.  Establishing Controls
3.  Performing Audits

Three-Step approach to ensure Security

-   The initial step identifies threats and uncovers the problems
-   The second step establishes controls
-   The final step is to discover the security breach
-   Audits are performed generally to ensure the effectiveness of controls

Why Cyber Security is important?

-   Cyber Security is not a one-time process to achieve
-   It is an ever-growing challenge encountered from time to time
-   When old problems are fixed and rectified, new targeted attacks challenge the Cyberspace
-   Cyber security is a process by itself and not the end

Hackers

-   Hackers are unauthorized users of a system
-   They invade a system through the vulnerabilities or weak points in the system
-   They make use of large diverse tools to harm a computer system
-   They gain access to computer systems through malicious logic

Important Terminologies

-   Vulnerability – any weakness in the system
-   Threat – possible danger to assets
-   Attack – evades security services and violates the security policy
-   Risk – possibility of suffering loss

Cyber Security Core Functions

-   Identify: Develop understanding. Manage systems, assets, data, and capabilities
-   Protect: Develop and implement safeguards. Ensure delivery of services
-   Detect: Identify the occurrence of cyber security events
-   Respond: Take action on the detected cyber security events
-   Recover: Resilience, Restoration

Four Important Fundamentals of Security

-   Protect the device
-   Protect the connection of devices
-   Protect email communication
-   Protect and backup electronic documents and files

Cyber Security Challenges

-   The increasing number of users and adoption of technology
-   Unrestricted or open access to Information
-   Lack of control mechanisms
-   The growing sophistication of threats
-   Lack of preparedness to handle the upcoming challenges
-   Inadequate and restricted handling of related crimes legally or the legal challenges

Types of Hackers

Vulnerability, Exploits, payloads
